1. Data Ingestion 📥
Download or load dataset (from URL, drive, or local).

Extract if it's zipped.

Save raw data to a structured location like artifacts/data_ingestion.

✅ Output: data.csv or dataset in a folder.

2. Data Validation ✅
Check if all required files are present.

Validate structure: columns like dialogue, summary, etc.

Optional: Check for missing/null values, types.

✅ Output: Status flag or log, and optionally a cleaned file.

3. Data Transformation 🔄
Load the validated dataset (e.g. CSV or HuggingFace dataset).

Tokenize input (dialogue) and target (summary) using a tokenizer like Pegasus, BART, T5.

Optionally: split into train/test.

Save as a tokenized dataset for model consumption.

✅ Output: Tokenized dataset (train, test) in HuggingFace format.

4. Model Trainer Setup 🏋️‍♂️
Load pre-trained model (AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM) from HuggingFace.

Configure TrainingArguments: batch size, learning rate, epochs, save steps, evaluation strategy.

Initialize Trainer with model, dataset, tokenizer, and arguments.

✅ Output: Trainer object ready to train.

5. Model Training 🧠
Train the model using trainer.train().

Logs, checkpoints, and best model saved to disk.

✅ Output: Trained model and tokenizer saved (e.g. in artifacts/model_trainer).

6. Model Evaluation 📊
Load test dataset.

Generate summaries with model.generate(...).

Decode tokenized output back to text.

Evaluate using ROUGE, BLEU, etc.

✅ Output: Evaluation metrics, predictions vs. references.

7. Prediction / Inference 🔍
Wrap model and tokenizer into a script or API.

Accept new dialogues and return summaries.

✅ Output: Real-time summary generation!

8. Model Deployment 🚀 (Optional)
Use FastAPI/Flask for web app.

Dockerize and deploy to Heroku, AWS, etc.

✅ Output: Live web service for summarization.
